/*Write a program to create a basic calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and perform all the operations
Hint => 
Create a variable number1 and number2 and take user inputs.
Perform Arithmetic Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division assign the result to a variable, and finally print the result
I/P => number1, number2
